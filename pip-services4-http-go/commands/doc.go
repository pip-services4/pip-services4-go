// Contains implementation of Command design patterns, which can be used to implement various remote
// procedure calls (RPCs). RPCs replace unique calls with universal "message transfer" calls, in which the
// message itself contains the called method's signature, as well as the parameters to pass for execution.
//
// When designing calls of methods/commands using the Command design pattern,
// uniform interfaces can be used, which, in turn, allow any amount of concrete methods to be called.
//
// Command design patterns can be used for intercepting messages and for various
// logging implementations.
//
// These design patterns allow us to create Commandable Interfaces, which are completely universal.
// If an object extends ICommandable and returns a CommandSet, then we can implement, with minimal code,
// a commandable client for this object, using various technologies.
//
// Commandable Interfaces – part of the command design pattern, used to make classes with certain logic,
// which are capable of receiving and processing commands in this universal form.
//
// Command interceptors – modify the message execution pipeline. Command interceptors are used to intercept
// calls, perform a set of actions, and, optionally, cancel the command's actual execution by simply returning a result.
// This logic is used in aspect-oriented programming. Aspect-oriented programming contains perpendicular logic
// (aspects, for example: logging, caching, blocking), which can be removed from the business logic and added to
// these perpendicular calls. When using interceptors, a command can pass through an execution chain, consisting of
// interceptors, which can:
//	- simply make some note of the command, notify, log, get metrics, or do some other passive task; or
//	- intercept the command completely and, for example, return a previous record of the call from the cache.
// A command’s return value can also be intercepted in a similar manner: the result can be written to cache,
// so that the next call doesn’t have to be made.
// Intercepted commands are used as pattern decorators in the command design pattern. They are represented
// as regular commands, but run their own logic before calling the actual command.

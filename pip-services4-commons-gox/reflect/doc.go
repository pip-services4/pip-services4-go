/*
Contains classes for data reflection. Reflects objects into parameters, methods. Most programming languages contain reflections, but they are all implemented differently. In the PipService framework, dynamic data types are often used. So as to not rewrite these dynamic data types differently for each language, this cross-language reflection package was written. All dynamic data types that are built on top of this package are portable from one language to another.
